# Exercise 1: Quizz
# Answer the following questions:
#
# 1.What is a class?  A class is a blueprint used
# to create objects. It defines the attributes (data)
# and methods (functions) that the created objects will have.

# 2.What is an instance? An instance is an object
# created from a class. Each instance has its own
# data while sharing the behavior defined in the class.

# 3.What is encapsulation? Encapsulation is the concept of restricting
# direct access to an object's internal data and allowing interaction
# with it only through defined methods or properties. It helps protect data and keep it controlled.

# 4.What is abstraction? Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary
# functionality to the user. The user interacts with what the object does, without needing to know how it works internally.

#5. What is inheritance? Inheritance is when one class (child class) inherits attributes and methods
# from another class (parent class). It allows code reuse and helps organize related classes.

# 6.What is multiple inheritance? Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits
# from more than one parent class, meaning it can receive functionality from multiple sources.

# 7.What is polymorphism? Polymorphism allows different classes to use methods with the same name
# but different implementations. The same method call can behave differently depending on the object that calls it

# 8.What is method resolution order or MRO? Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order Python follows to search for methods
# and attributes in a class hierarchy, especially when inheritance or multiple inheritance is used.
