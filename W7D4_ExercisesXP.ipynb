        "The main features for loan analysis is a repayment history, credit score and income amount. Because, they can show us does an applicant has a positive history of making timely payment on previous loans or negative. Credit score gives an understanding of creditworthiness of the applicant and incom level helps us to suggest will it be a lower risk of default or high, is his financial stability low or high. An important role in analysis have loan amount, term and purpose of the loan.\n",
        "Higher loan amounts may increase the risk of default, especially if the borrower has limited income or financial resources. The reason for taking out the loan can also influence the likelihood of default the same as a term. The duration of the loan can impact default rates. Longer loan terms may increase the risk of default, as there is more time for financial circumstances to change.\n",
        "And of course we should pay attantion to the age of applicant, as younger applicants may have less financial experience and stability compared to older applicants. However, this may vary depending on the context."

        "For the supervised learning we can choose the strategy to split the dataset into training and testing sets. Than train the model in the training set using an algorithm such as logistic regression, decision trees or random forests. We can use such metrics as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and the cross validation and ROC method. Accuracy will show us overall correctness of the model, precision - proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, recall - proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives, F1-score - harmonic mean of precision and recall. Conserning the methods we choose, cross-validation helps us to ensure the model's generalization ability, use k-fold cross-validation and the ROC curves method is the nice way to make a plot to visualize the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.\n",

We will use the sihouette score, that will measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. And we can use the elbow method to make a plot that will show us the optimal number of clusters. Than we can use metrics like Daviesâ€“Bouldin index or Calinski-Harabasz index to evaluate cluster validity. But evaluating clustering performance can be subjective as it relies on intrinsic cluster quality measures. Interpretability of clusters may vary depending on the algorithm and data.\n",

        "For the reinforcement learning we can choose the strategy that will define a suitable reward function that reflects the desired behavior of the RL agent. Than we can train the RL agent using algorithms like Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks, or Policy Gradient methods. Than we will evaluate the RL agent's performance based on its interaction with the environment over multiple episodes. We can use the cumulative reward to see total reward accumulated by the agent over time, convergence to measure how quickly the agent learns optimal behavior, and exploration vs. exploitation balance. Evaluating RL models can be complex due to the dynamic nature of the environment and the long-term nature of reward accumulation. RL models may suffer from the exploration-exploitation dilemma, where the agent may need to sacrifice short-term rewards for long-term gains."
